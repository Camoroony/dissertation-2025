It offers a lot of variety in exercises to learn whilst remaining relatively low in sets to not overtraining people just starting out. It may be have slightly too many exercises but overall this is good.'),(6,1,3,0,'I appreciate the amount of exercises being given to a beginner in this plan, but I think it\'s way too many exercises within singular sessions, you could definitely cut at least two from each session and still get enough training in.'),(7,1,6,1,'Great beginner plan! Good for learning different movements, I like that most exercises are only 2 RIR per set to prevent too much fatigue in exercises. A good way to get started and learn!'),(8,1,5,1,'Good plan! Using a combination of machine and free weight exercises is a great way to learn movements and how muscles are used in different exercises, I approve!'),(9,2,7,1,'A good dumbbell based plan! I did notice the AI has added some arm exercises to the end of the lower day sessions which it should not do for an upper/lower split, but if you removed these exercises I think the rest of the plan it pretty good.'),(10,2,8,0,'Although I appreciate the dumbbell only nature of this plan, the additional arm exercises at the end of the lower days are problematic. There is also too much emphasis on chest exercises in the first upper day for me, I\'d prefer more muscle balance.'),(11,2,3,1,'I would maybe think about cutting a chest exercise out of the first upper session and removing the arm exercises, but other than this, the plan is very well rounded for developing all muscle groups and provides good dumbbell exercises!'),(12,3,5,0,'I think the exercises in this plan are great, but for training for 5 consecutive days, this plan has way too much volume, training the same muscle 5 days in a row for 3 sets each day is going to be way too fatiguing. '),(13,3,4,1,'I\'d say if you cut down the sets to maybe 1 or 2 per exercise, this could be a good plan. 3 is a bit excessive when your training the same muscle with no rest days in between, but with this minor change I think this is a great plan to follow.'),(14,3,7,1,'As an advanced lifter, following this plan has been great for me, with some tweaks mentioned by the previous comments. It\'s really helped to train my muscle groups more frequently throughout the week and I\'ve seen great results from it!'),(15,3,6,1,'A great plan with some minor adjustments. Lower all the 3 set exercises by 1 so you don\'t overtrain, and consider adjusting your sets up or down from that point based on your own experience. If you find your very sore after day one, lower the sets.'),(16,3,8,1,'Thanks for the advice people! I lowered the first day sets to 2 per exercise and found that I didn\'t feel particularly fatigued until day 5 before the 2 rest days. The increased training frequency has really helped me put on some more muscle, thanks!'),(17,3,3,0,'For me personally, I\'ve found that training with higher sets per muscle group with less frequency to be way better for muscle growth, I have tried this plan for a couple of months but the high frequency training doesn\'t seem recoverable for me.'),(18,4,4,1,'Overall, this plan does a good job at avoiding shoulder movements to account for an individual with a shoulder injury. This may be a plan you need to trial with your injury as some chest exercises involve the shoulders, so be cautious when starting.'),(19,4,3,0,'If you injury is at the front of your shoulder muscles, I would personally avoid this plan, bench press and dip movements use the frontal head of your shoulder too much to provide it with enough rest to recover and heal.'),(20,4,8,1,'An improvement that could be made to this plan is to also cut down on some chest work to avoid shoulder use even more as they are often used in chest exercises. I recommend shifting more sets over to the back exercises like lat pulldown/pull ups'),(21,9,4,1,'Good beginner plan for those who can only train using bodyweight exercises. I would like to see a bit more transparency from the plan on the equipment as you still need parallel bars and a pull-up bar to perform some exercises, but still great!'),(22,9,7,1,'I like the variety this plan provides for people looking to cover all muscle groups with only their bodyweight and minimal equipment! It could benefit from a bit more balance between back and chest exercises as it is very push up oriented '),(23,9,8,1,'As a beginner, I found a lot of these exercises very useful as I am very busy and unable to access a gym very often. This has helped me to find a way to still train in my busy schedule, I love it! '),(24,9,5,1,'Awesome plan, shows a lot of variety in exercises that you can mostly perform at home or in a park. I\'d recommend upping the sets on some exercises and going past the specified rep ranges all the way to failure once you get used to the movements'),(25,9,3,0,'The rep ranges are not accurate for a beginner, you may be able to do 12 push ups, but 12 pull ups for a beginner is very hard, I\'d recommend changing the rep ranges to match your strength and increase as you get stronger or find different exercises'),(26,9,6,1,'I\'d agree with the comment above, definitely search for less challenging variations of pull ups or other back exercises as a beginner to do before progressing onto bodyweight pull ups as they are very challenging, but the rest is good to start out.'),(27,10,3,1,'Good plan! I like that there is less emphasis on upper body through the decrease in sets to allow for more focus on lower body exercises. I would like to see more than one calf exercise per lower body session to increase the volume more though'),(28,10,6,0,'I think doing a push pull legs upper lower split for focusing on calfs is a bit pointless as you spend most of your time training upper body, I\'d recommend doing three leg days a week instead of two and maybe 2 upper body days '),(29,10,4,1,'I think this is a good plan, although I would make one major tweak. Add calf session to your upper body days! If your training calfs twice a week and you have lowered your upper body volume ,add another 3/4 sets of calfs to get more volume in!'),(30,10,7,1,'I agree with the comment above, adding more sets to calfs on the upper body days when you doing less volume will give you an additional day of training calfs, just make sure you put it on day that allows them to recover for the next session.'),(31,2,4,0,'Too many chest exercises for me, cut down on it!'),(32,2,5,1,'Remove the dumbbell press on the first upper day and I think the plan would be more well-rounded, less overall fatigue and more energy to perform better on other exercises afterwards'),(33,4,7,1,'I found that the chest exercises were fine to do, bit the dips hurt my shoulders, I removed this exercise for the plan and the rest worked well for me!
