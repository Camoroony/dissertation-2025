I would say for an intermediate doing 5 sets of split squats is a bit too intensive, especially when the other leg movements are only performed with one rest day, would prefer to see maybe 4 sets per leg exercise'),(19,2,7,0,'For a leg-focused plan this needs some form of calf raises in my opinion'),(20,2,4,1,'I like the intensity of this plan with its compound leg movements! some calf work would be good to include but other than that this is solid, I\'d maybe advise swapping out one exercise on the final day for some calf raises and then its good to go!'),(21,3,5,1,'I like the inclusion of additional arm exercises into this plan for sure! I think some other exercises could do with being slightly lower volume to accommodate added arm sets but I other than that I think this is a solid plan for advanced lifters :)'),(22,3,1,1,'Good amount of additional sets put in here for arm exercises, would like to see maybe a little bit more balance between the bicep and tricep work, currently the biceps are being focused on more than triceps, but that is an easy fix. Still great!'),(23,3,2,0,'I would have expected to see more balance between biceps and triceps for my liking considering arms is the overall focus'),(24,3,7,1,'Good amount of shoulder, bicep and tricep work in this program, would like to see a bit less volume in other exercises to handle the additional load on arms better, but still a killer arm focused plan!'),(25,5,6,1,'I think this is a great plan to follow for beginners for sure! I like that it includes a lot of variation in exercises to get the individual to get accustomed to movements. I would like to see a view less exercises however as there are quite a lot.

For anyone looking top take this on, I\'d recommend this or pushing 2 or 3 exercises from each day into a 3rd session. Other than that, still a good plan'),(29,5,1,1,'I agree with the comment above, push a few exercises into another day and then this is good to go, also a great way to learn exclusively dumbbell exercises if you only have access to that equipment!'),(30,4,1,1,'This is a good bodyweight plan to follow! Just make sure you have a bench and some form of bar you can hang on to perform the dips and leg raises, but other than that, this is good for those who don\'t have a lot of gym access'),(31,4,2,0,'I would have been nice for the plan to specify that you need a hanging bar and bench to perform some of the exercises, still like this plan but a little misleading '),(32,4,7,1,'If you have something like a at home pull up bar to hang on and a bench for dips, this is a great plan. I would say you can probably get rid of some exercises like push up variations and do more normal pushup sets, but that is just nitpicking'),(34,4,8,1,'Good plan, love the push up variations, would prefer some form of pull up in the plan instead of chin-ups in my opinion, seeing as it will target the back muscles more effectively, but you can decide that for yourself as chin-ups are still good!'),(35,4,4,1,'I would like to see a bit more back exercises than all the push up variations, but I still think this is a good overall plan, maybe just swap out some push up movements for some pull ups or chin ups if your looking for more upper body volume balance'),(36,8,1,1,'A good plan!!
