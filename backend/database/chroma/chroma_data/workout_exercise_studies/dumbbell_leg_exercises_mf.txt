1 - Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts (Dumbbell/Full gym access leg/hamstring exercise)
Start standing and hold both dumbbells in front of your legs.
Bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips, lowering the dumbbells down to your shins.
Once the dumbbells reach your mid shins, rise to stand again. Keep your spine neutral throughout the movement.

Hold the dumbbell with both hands in front of your chest and place your feet hips width apart, toes slightly pointing outwards.
Sink down into a squat position until your thighs are at least parallel with the floor.
Pause at the bottom then rise back to stand leading with your chest.
