1. Bodyweight Crunch (Bodyweight abs/core exercise)
Let’s start off with a classic. Lie faceup with knees bent and hands behind head. Inhale and, as you exhale, draw your belly button in toward your spine.
Press lower back into the floor and lift upper back off the floor and slightly forward. Lower to return to the starting position. That’s 1 rep.


5. Bodyweight Reverse crunch (Bodyweight abs/core exercise)
Lie faceup with lower back pressed into the floor. Place hands behind head or extend them out alongside your body.
Keeping legs straight or crossing legs at ankles, lift feet up. Pull lower back off the floor as you contract abs. Reach legs toward the ceiling with each contraction.
