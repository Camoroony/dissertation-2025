1. Bodyweight calf raises (Bodyweight leg/calf exercise)
Calf raises can be performed anywhere there is an elevated surface â€” such as a stairwell or a curb. Include these in your body-weight calf exercises, as demonstrated by ExRx.net.
How to:
Find a step approximately 4 inches off the ground.
Stand with the back half of your foot hanging off the step.
Lower your heels 2 inches.
Press up so that you are standing on the balls of your feet.
Repeat this exercise with your toes pointed outward and then inward to target different parts of your calf muscles.
