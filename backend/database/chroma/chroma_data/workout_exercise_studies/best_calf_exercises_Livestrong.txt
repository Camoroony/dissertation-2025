Top 5 Calf Exercises Without Weights

There are a lot of calf exercises you can do without weights.
Two major muscles, called the gastrocnemius and the soleus, run down the back of the lower leg. The soleus is a long, wide muscle that sits below the smaller, more bulbous gastrocnemius. These two primary muscles form your calves. These muscles can be strengthened with body-weight calf exercises.
Since your calf muscle contracts to extend your feet and toes, strong calf muscles are important in a variety of sports. Perform calf exercises without equipment two times a week to keep them defined and muscular.
VIDEO OF THE DAY


1. Calf Raises (Bodyweight leg/calf exercise)
Calf raises can be performed anywhere there is an elevated surface â€” such as a stairwell or a curb. Include these in your body-weight calf exercises, as demonstrated by ExRx.net.
How to:
Find a step approximately 4 inches off the ground.
Stand with the back half of your foot hanging off the step.
Lower your heels 2 inches.
Press up so that you are standing on the balls of your feet.
Repeat this exercise with your toes pointed outward and then inward to target different parts of your calf muscles.
