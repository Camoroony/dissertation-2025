1. Standing Overhead Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The overhead press is a full shoulder workout in a single exercise—it trains your front, rear, and side delts, rotator cuff muscles, and upper back. It also allows you to handle heavy weights safely and progress regularly, so it’s an outstanding exercise for overall shoulder mass and strength.
How to:
Set a barbell in a rack at the same height as your upper chest. 
Grip the bar with a shoulder-width grip and your palms facing away from you.
Unrack the barbell, step backward, and plant your feet just outside of shoulder width.
Push the bar toward the ceiling until your arms are straight.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

2. Push Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The push press is a dynamic shoulder exercise that allows you to use lower-body momentum to press heavier weights overhead. As such, it’s not only fundamental for building shoulder mass but also essential for developing explosive power, which is particularly beneficial for athletes looking to enhance shoulder strength and size.   
How to:
Set a barbell in a rack at the same height as your upper chest. 
Grip the bar with a shoulder-width grip and your palms facing away from you.
Unrack the barbell, step backward, and plant your feet just outside of shoulder width.
Drop your butt 3-to-6 inches by bending your knees, then shoot your hips upward and  explosively straighten your knees.
Press the bar straight up using the momentum generated by your lower body.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

3. Seated Overhead Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The seated overhead press is a staple in many full shoulder workouts because it doesn’t involve as much core stability as standing overhead presses. This means you can lift heavier weights and progress faster on the seated overhead press than most other shoulder exercises, making it ideal for gaining shoulder mass. 
How to:
Set up an upright bench in a squat rack or use a seated barbell overhead press station.
Set a barbell in the rack at about shoulder height when standing.
Sit down and grip the bar with a shoulder-width grip and your palms facing away from you.
Unrack the barbell and lower it to your collarbone.
Press the bar toward the ceiling and return to the starting position.

4. Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The dumbbell shoulder press trains all three heads of the delts as well as your traps, making it a top-tier exercise for developing the entire shoulder region.
How to:
Sit on an upright bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand, resting them on your thighs. 
Hoist the dumbbells up so you’re holding them just above your shoulders with your palms facing away from you.
Press the dumbbells toward the ceiling until your arms are straight.
Lower the dumbbells and return to the starting position.

---

5. Standing Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: Research shows the standing dumbbell shoulder press trains all three heads of the deltoids to a higher degree than most other overhead pressing exercises, so it’s an excellent variation for a full deltoid workout. 
Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand. 
Hoist the dumbbells up so you’re holding them just above your shoulders with your palms facing away from you.
Press the dumbbells toward the ceiling until your arms are straight.
Lower the dumbbells and return to the starting position.

---

6. Arnold Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The Arnold press contributes to well-rounded shoulder mass by emphasizing your side delts more than other overhead pressing variations. In other words, it’s particularly well-suited to people looking to add width and size to their delts.  
How to:
Sit on an upright bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand, resting them on your thighs.
Hoist the dumbbells up so you’re holding them just in front of your shoulders with your palms facing you.
Press the dumbbells straight overhead while rotating your wrists until your arms are straight and your palms are facing away from you.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

---

7. Machine Shoulder Press (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The machine shoulder press is a good option for training your deltoid muscles if you’re new to weightlifting, working around an injury, don’t have access to a barbell or dumbbells, or want to change up your training.
How to:
Adjust the shoulder press machine’s seat so the handles are about the same height as your ears, then sit down.
Grip the handles with your palms facing away from you, then press them toward the ceiling until your arms are straight.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

---

8. Dumbbell Side Lateral Raise (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The dumbbell side lateral raise isolates your side delts, making it perfect for building broad, complete shoulders.
How to:
Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand. 
Raise the dumbbells out to your sides until your upper arm is parallel to the floor.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.


---


9. Cable Side Lateral Raise (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: Like the dumbbell side lateral raise, the cable lateral raise isolates the side delts, which is crucial for building wide, proportional shoulders. 
How to: 
Set the pulley on a cable machine to the lowest setting and attach a single handle attachment.
Stand with your feet either touching or shoulder-width apart, parallel to the handle, and your right foot closer to the handle than your left. 
Grab the handle with your left hand and the machine with your right hand (most people prefer to grab the metal column that holds the pulleys), then lean your body to the left until your right arm fully extends. 
Raise your left hand out to the side until your upper arm is parallel to the floor. 
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position. 
Once you’ve completed the desired number of reps, switch sides and repeat the process with your right arm.

---


10. Upright Row (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The upright row trains your side delts similarly to the side lateral raise, making it an excellent exercise for rounding out shoulder development. That said, some people find the upright row unkind on their rotator cuff muscles and shoulder joints. To avoid this, simply raise the weight until your upper arm is parallel to the floor and no further.
How to:
Stand up straight and hold a barbell in front of your thighs with your palms facing you.
Lift the bar straight upward until your upper arms are parallel with the floor, keeping your elbows higher than your forearms throughout the movement. 
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

---


11. Dumbbell Rear Lateral Raise (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: Many weightlifters neglect their rear delts compared to their front and side delts, which can cause strength and size imbalances that blight your upper-body aesthetics and increase your risk of injury. The dumbbell rear lateral raise helps you avoid this by prioritizing your rear delts.
How to:
Whether standing or seated, bend at the hips so that your upper body is as close to parallel to the floor as possible.
Hold a dumbbell in each hand, and while keeping your back flat, lift the dumbbells out to the side until your upper arm is parallel to the floor. As you lift the dumbbells, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

---


12. Machine Reverse Fly (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The machine reverse fly isolates the rear delts, the often-neglected muscles on the rear of your shoulder that are crucial for complete shoulder development and mass.
How to:
Sit down with your body facing the machine and grab the handles with your palms facing down.
While maintaining a slight bend in your elbows, move the weight back in an arc until your arms are directly out to your sides (or slightly behind your body). As you lift the weight, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

---


13. Barbell Rear Delt Row (Shoulder Exercise):
Why: The barbell rear delt row trains your posterior deltoids similarly to the dumbbell rear lateral raise, ensuring full shoulder development and contributing significantly to overall shoulder mass and strength.
How to:
Position your feet about shoulder-width apart with your toes pointed slightly outward.
Grab a barbell with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip and your palms facing you.
Flatten your back so it’s roughly parallel to the floor, and let your arms hang straight down.
Pull the barbell to your mid-chest, flaring your elbows at about a 60-degree angle relative to your body. As you lift the weight, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.
