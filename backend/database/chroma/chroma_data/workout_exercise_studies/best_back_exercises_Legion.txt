2. Pull-up (Bodyweight/Full gym access Back exercise)

**Main Advantages:**  
The pull-up trains most back muscles but is particularly effective for training your lats, which is important for developing the aesthetic “V-taper.” It also trains your biceps, abs, and even your chest muscles to a lesser extent.

**How to:**  
- Grab a pull-up bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart with your palms facing away from you.  
- Lift your feet so that you’re hanging with your arms straight.  
- Pull your body up until your chin is above the bar.  
- Once your chin has passed the bar, reverse the movement and return to the starting position.  

**Expert Tip:**  
Pulling yourself up with enough force to “smash” your chest into the bar helps you attack each rep with the intensity you need to get your chin over the bar.

3. Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (Dumbbell Back exercise)

**Main Advantages:**  
The one-arm dumbbell row trains each side of your back independently, helping you find and fix muscle imbalances. It can also help you establish a stronger “mind-muscle connection” and may enhance athletic performance more than back exercises that train both sides of your body simultaneously.

**How to:**  
- Hold a dumbbell in your right hand.  
- Plant your left knee and hand firmly on a bench, your right foot on the floor a foot or two from the bench, and let your right arm hang straight down toward the floor.  
- Keeping your back straight, pull the dumbbell upward until it touches your torso, and then return the dumbbell to the starting position.  
- Once you’ve completed the desired number of reps, repeat the process with your left arm.  

**Expert Tip:**  
The one-arm dumbbell row has an unusual resistance curve—each rep feels easiest when you’re strongest (at the bottom) and hardest when you’re weakest (at the top).  
To overcome this, use a little momentum to make the top portion of each rep easier, allowing for a full range of motion and more reps.

4. Cable Pullover (Back exercise)

**Main Advantages:**  
The cable pullover trains your lats in a fully stretched position and through a long range of motion, which makes it highly effective for gaining lat size.

**How to:**  
- Set the pulley to the highest position on a cable machine and attach the rope handle.  
- Hold one end of the rope in each hand and step away from the pulley until you feel tension in the cable.  
- Lean forward until your body makes a 45-degree angle with the floor and your arms are nearly straight overhead.  
- Set your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees slightly.  
- Keep a small bend in your elbows and pull the rope in an arc toward your feet until your hands are by your thighs or slightly past them.  
- Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.
