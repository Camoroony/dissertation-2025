3. Nordic hamstring curl (Bodyweight leg/hamstring exercise)
Nordic curls are a highly effective hamstring exercise because they prioritize eccentric contraction (the lowering phase).
If you’re not using a machine to stabilize your feet, you can simply ask a partner to hold your feet and ankles down, or you can use a couch or other piece of furniture, as demonstrated below.
How to:
Kneel on the floor with your back straight up and feet flexed.
Have a partner hold your ankles, using their body weight as a counterweight. Alternatively, put your feet under a couch with your heels up against the edge of it.
Keeping your hands in front of you for safety, slowly lower yourself toward the floor until you can no longer control the descent. You should feel a pull in your hamstrings. Avoid bending at the hips and focus on bending at the knees. Make sure your back stays flat.
Push your hands into the floor to lift yourself enough so that you can lift back to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
Perform 2–3 sets of 8–12 reps.
The main focus of this exercise is the lowering phase, so be sure to take your time and focus on proper form.
If your partner is struggling to hold you, try having them lean forward as you lower, which will put more of their weight over your ankles.
