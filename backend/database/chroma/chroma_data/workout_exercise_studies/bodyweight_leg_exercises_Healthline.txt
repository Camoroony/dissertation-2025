Bodyweight squat (Bodyweight leg exercise)
The classic standard bodyweight squat can be performed virtually anywhere. You can wear standard workout shoes or even bare feet when performing this exercise (1).
How to:
Stand with your feet around shoulder-width apart and turned out 5–12 degrees.
Begin the motion by moving your hips backward, sitting back, and lowering your hips. Reach your arms out in front for counterbalance.
As you sit back, generate tension in your feet and legs by imagining you’re pushing your knees outward and sitting down between your thighs, as opposed to on top of them. This is to counteract the tendency to let your knees cave or turn inward.
Lower your hips until the tops of your thighs are parallel to the floor. You can go lower if your mobility allows.
Once you reach the bottom position, push through each foot evenly to stand up to the starting position.
Keep your knees pointing in the same direction as your toes throughout the entire range of motion.
Your torso should be roughly at the same angle as your shins throughout the motion. This means that you’ll lean slightly forward as you squat down, and your knees will move slightly forward as well.
When you’re first learning the bodyweight squat, start at a slow speed and practice before increasing your tempo.


Bodyweight lunge (Bodyweight leg exercise)
The standard bodyweight lunge is the first lunge variation you should learn.
How to:
Begin standing with your feet hip-width apart.
Take a large step forward. The exact distance will depend on your body size but should be roughly 2–3 times the distance of a normal walking step. Your front foot should be pointing directly forward. Your back foot will be turned out very slightly.
Lower your hips by slowly bringing your back knee toward the ground. Actively rotate your back foot inward and raise your back heel as you lower your knee for optimal movement. Your front knee will bend as your center of mass lowers.
Continue lowering your body until your back knee is just off the ground. At the bottom of the lunge, your front shin should be perpendicular to the floor or angled forward slightly.
Push through your front foot to stand straight back up to the starting position.
You can alternate legs each repetition or stay in the staggered stance and perform one side all the way through before switching.
If you find yourself losing balance, be sure that your feet stay hip-width apart even once you take your step forward. There should be an imaginary diagonal line from your front foot to your rear foot.
You may also prefer to take a step backward to enter the initial staggered stance position, sometimes known as a reverse lunge. All other aspects remain the same.


Bodyweight split lunge (Bodyweight leg exercise)
The split lunge, also called the Bulgarian split squat or just split squat in the fitness community, is a more advanced lunge variation in which your rear foot is elevated on a surface such as a chair or bench.
How to:
Begin standing lunge-distance in front of a roughly 18-inch (45.7-cm) tall chair seat with your feet hip-width apart.
Place one leg behind you on the chair. You can have the balls of your feet and toes on the chair or point your foot, so the top of your foot is in contact with the chair. Try both positions to see which is more comfortable.
At the top position, your front shin should have a slight rearward angle.
Lower your hips by slowly bringing your back knee toward the ground. Focus on lowering your back knee and hips and avoid driving forward with your front knee.
Continue lowering your body until the top of your front thigh is parallel to the ground. At the bottom of the split lunge, your front shin should be perpendicular to the floor or angled forward slightly.
Push through your front foot to return to the starting position. Focus your pressure in the rear-third area of your front foot.
You can alternate legs each repetition or stay in the staggered stance and perform one side all the way through before switching.
The split lunge will take a few workouts to get used to.
